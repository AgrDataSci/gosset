# Core ideas 

-	We developed the freely available and open-source R package gosset
-	The package functionality support rank-based analysis and synthesis of data from crop variety evaluations.
-	The package facilitates tasks in the main stages of the data analysis workflow.

# Abstract

Reproducible and efficient workflows are fundamental in scientific research [@Lowndes2017]. Data analysis workflows roughly include the following stages: (1) Data preparation and cleaning, (2) modelling and validation, and (3) results presentation. It is also common that those stages would be repeated iteratively until a solution is found which satisfies the initial objectives. Every of these stages presents different difficulties and constraints for the researchers. Digital tools can facilitate the tasks within those stages, but it is necessary to choose the right tool, if any, for the intended work. While not frequently used, experimental approaches using ranking data are being applied for the evaluation of crop varieties. Recently developed rank-based approaches for on-farm experimentation, such as the tricot methodology [@vanEtten2019], required customized tools for all the aforementioned stages. On the other, new rank-based data synthesis approaches also required tailored tools to facilitate all the involved stages. Along with those experiences, we developed the R package gosset, supporting several activities in the analysis of experiments in agronomy and crop science. The main objective of this paper is to describe and demonstrate the functionality of the package.

# Introduction


# Materials and Methods



```r
library("climatrends")
library("sf")
library("nasapower")

# create a polygon within the coordinates 7, 17, 59, 63
e <- matrix(c(7, 59, 17, 59, 17, 63,
              7, 63, 7, 59), 
            nrow = 5, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

e <- st_polygon(list(e))

# sample 100 points in the hexagonal type
p <- st_sample(e, 100, type = "hexagonal")
p <- st_as_sf(p, crs = 4326)

# compute the temperature indices using the random points 
temp <- temperature(p, day.one = "2000-01-01", last.day = "2019-12-31", 
                    timeseries = TRUE, intervals = 365)
```
