abstract: |
  Appropriate data management and analysis are necessary to produce practical information from agronomy and crop science experimental data. There is also an ongoing trend advocating for programmatic tools that supports reproducible workflows in scientific research. Recently developed approaches for data analysis and synthesis based on ranking data lack of customized analytical software to facilitate data science workflows. We present the R package gosset, which provides functions to support data preparation, modelling, validation, and results presentation with rank-based models, such as Plackett-Luce and Bradley-Terry. We demonstrate the functionality of the package with a case of on-farm evaluations of common bean (*Phaseolus vulgaris* L.) varieties in Nicaragua.

Reproducible and efficient workflows are fundamental in scientific research [@Lowndes2017]. Data analysis workflows roughly include the following stages: (1) Data preparation and cleaning, (2) modelling and validation, and (3) results presentation. It is also common that those stages would be repeated iteratively until a solution is found which satisfies the initial objectives. Every of these stages presents different difficulties and constraints for the researchers. Digital tools can facilitate the tasks within those stages, but it is necessary to choose the right tool, if any, for the intended work. While not frequently used, experimental approaches using ranking data are being applied for the evaluation of crop varieties. Recently developed rank-based approaches for on-farm experimentation, such as the tricot methodology (Van Etten et al., 2019), required customized tools for all the aforementioned stages. On the other, new rank-based data synthesis approaches also required tailored tools to facilitate all the involved stages. Along with those experiences, we developed the R package gosset, supporting several activities in the analysis of experiments in agronomy and crop science.

# Software description

*Describe the software in as much as is necessary to establish a vocabulary needed to explain its impact.*

The R package gosset provides functionality supporting the data analysis workflows in experimental agriculture, especially with rank-based approaches in on-farm experimental agriculture. Typically, this data analysis workflow includes (1) data management and preparation, (2) modelling and (3) results visualization and presentation.

## Software Architecture

*Give a short overview of the overall software architecture; provide a pictorial component overview or similar (if possible). If necessary provide implementation details.*

## Software Functionalities

*Present the major functionalities of the software.*

**Data management and preparation**

When data from agricultural experiments is not in ranking format, it should be transformed to be used as inputs into R packages for the analysis of ranking data. For instance, the Plackett-Luce model (Luce, 1959; Plackett, 1975) is implemented in the R package as PlackettLuce, which requires the data to be formatted as ranking matrix. Another example is the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley & Terry, 1952), implemented in the package BradleyTerry2 (Turner & Firth, 2012) and requires the input data to be formatted as paired comparisons. For these cases, gosset provides the functions rank_numeric and rank_binomial. The function rank_numeric transforms a set of numeric values into an ordinal ranking, considering if higher numeric values should be ranked first or not. The function rank_binomial transforms data in rankings format into pairwise comparisons, as required by the package BradleyTerry2. Additionally, gosset provides the function rank_tricot, for the case when the experimental data is generated from trial established using the Triadic Comparison of Technologies (tricot) approach [@vanEtten2019].

**Modelling**

The gosset package provides complementary functions for validation of models Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, Generalized Linear and Generalized Nonlinear. The function pseudoR2 computes goodness-of-fit measures such as Cragg-Uhler (Cragg & Uhler, 1970) and McFadden's R2 (McFadden, 1973). The function AIC computes the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1974).
