abstract: |
  Appropriate data management and analysis are necessary to produce practical information from agronomy and crop science experimental data. There is also an ongoing trend advocating for programmatic tools that supports reproducible workflows in scientific research. Recently developed approaches for data analysis and synthesis based on ranking data lack of customized analytical software to facilitate data science workflows. We present the R package gosset, which provides functions to support data preparation, modelling, validation, and results presentation with rank-based models, such as Plackett-Luce and Bradley-Terry. We demonstrate the functionality of the package with a case of on-farm evaluations of common bean (*Phaseolus* vulgaris L.) varieties in Nicaragua.

# Software description

*Describe the software in as much as is necessary to establish a
vocabulary needed to explain its impact.*

The R package gosset provides functionality supporting the data analysis workflows in experimental agriculture, especially with rank-based approaches in on-farm experimental agriculture. Typically, this data analysis workflow includes (1) data management and preparation, (2) modelling and (3) results visualization and presentation.

## Software Architecture

*Give a short overview of the overall software architecture; provide a
pictorial component overview or similar (if possible). If necessary
provide implementation details.*



## Software Functionalities

*Present the major functionalities of the software.*

**Data management and preparation**


## Sample code snippets analysis (optional)

# Illustrative Examples

*Provide at least one illustrative example to demonstrate the major
