# *gosset*: Modelling Metadata and Experimental Citizen Science <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

## Overview

The **gosset** package provides the toolkit for a workflow on modelling
metadata and experimental citizen science data, from collating data of
different sources, model sellection and visualisation. The package is
named after W.S. Gosset aka ‘Student’, a pioneer of modern statistics in
small sample experimental design and analysis.

## Installation

The development version can be installed via

``` r

library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("agrobioinfoservices/gosset", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

## Going further

The full functionality of **gosset** is illustrated in the package
vignette. The vignette can be found on the [package
website](https://agrobioinfoservices.github.io/gosset/) or from within
`R` once the package has been installed, e.g. via

``` r

vignette("Overview", package = "gosset")
```
